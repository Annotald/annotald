Annotald
========

Annotald is a program for annotating parsed corpora in the Penn Treebank
format.  For more information on the format (as instantiated by the Penn
Parsed Corpora of Historical English), see `the documentation by
Beatrice Santorini`_.  Annotald was originally written by `Anton
Ingason`_ as part of the `Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus`_ project.
It is currently being developed by him along with `Jana Beck`_ and
`Aaron Ecay`_.
