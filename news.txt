Release 11.12:
- Various bugs fixed
- Support for ID and METADATA nodes, as sisters of the clause root.
  (Currently, nodes other than ID and METADATA will not work.)
- Change how the coloring is applied to clause roots.  Call
  styleIpNodes() in settings.js after setting the ipnodes variable.
- Add mechanism to hide certain tags from view; see settings.js for
  details.
- Added mousewheel support; use shift+wheel-up/-down to move through the
  tree, sisterwise
– Limit undo history to 15 steps.  This limits how much memory is used
  by Annotald, which could be very high.
- Allow (optional) specification of port on the commandline:
  annotald -p <number> <optional settings file> <.psd file>
  This allows multiple instances of Annotald ot be running at once (each
  on a different port)

Release 11.11:
- Proper Unicode support on OS X and Linux
- Remove dependency on a particular charset in parsed files
- Code cleanup (see hacking.txt for instructions/style guide)
- Add support for lemmata in (POS word-lemma) format
- Speed up the moving of nodes in some cases
- Add a notification message when save completes successfully
- Add an “exit” button, which kills the Annotald server and closes the
  browser window.  Exit will fail if there are unsaved changes
- Change behavior of mouse click selection.  Previously, the following
  behavior was extant:
  1) Click a node
  2) Change the node’s label with a keybaord command
  3) Click another node to select it
  Result: the just-clicked node is made the selection endpoint
  This can be surprising.  Now, in order to make a secondary selection,
  the two mouseclicks must immediately follow each other, without any
  intervening keystrokes.
- Allow context-sensitive label switching commands.  See the included
  settings.js file for an example
- (Experimental) Add a CSS class to each node in the tree corresponding
  to its syntactic label.  This facilitates the specification of
  additional CSS rules (for an example, see the settings file)
- Keybindings can now be specified with control and shift modifier keys
  (though not both together).  The second argument (action to be taken)
  for a binding can now be an arbitrary javascript function; the third
  argument is the argument (singular for now) to be passed to the
  function.
