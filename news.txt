Release 12.03:
This is the first release since 11.12.  Changes in this version
(asterisks indicate potentially backwards-incompatible changes):
* The handling of dash tags has been overhauled.  Annotald now has
  three separate lists of allowable dash tags: one list for dash tags
  on word-level labels, one for dash tags on clausal nodes (IP and CP),
  and one for dash tags on non-clausal non-leaf nodes.  Refer to the
  settings.js file distributed with Annotald to see how to configure
  these options.
* Annotald is now licensed under the GPL, version 3 or higher.
- Added support for validation queries.  Use the command-line option -v
  <path> to the annotald script to specify a validation script.  Click the
  “Validate” button in the annotald interface to invoke the script.  The
  script should read trees on standard input, and write (possibly modified)
  trees to standard output.  The output of the script will replace the
  content of the annotald page.  By convention, the script should add the
  dash tag -FLAG to nodes that are considered errors.  The “next error”
  button will scroll the document to the next occurrence of FLAG.  The
  fixError function is available for user keybindings, and removes the
  -FLAG from the selected node.  The -FLAG tag is automatically removed by
  Annotald on save.
  NOTE: the specifics of this interface are expected to change in future
  versions.
- Added a comment editor.  Press ‘l’ with a comment selected to pop up a
  text box to edit the text of the comment.  Spaces in the original text
  are converted to underscores in the tree representation.  A comment is
  defined as a CODE node whose text is enclosed in curly braces {}, and
  the first part of the text inside the braces is one of “COM:”,
  “TODO:”, or “MAN:”.  The three types of comment can be toggled
  between, using the buttons at the bottom left of the dialog box.
- Added time-logging support.  Annotald will write a “timelog.txt” file
  in the working directory, with information about when the program is
  started/stopped/the file is saved.  Jana Beck’s (as yet unreleased)
  CorpusReader tool can be used to calculate parsing time and
  words-per-hour statistics.
- Added a facility to edit CorpusSearch .out files.  These files have
  extraneous comments added by CS.  Give the -o command-line flag to the
  annotald program, and the comments will be removed so that Annotald
  can successfully parse the trees.
- Annotald successfully runs on systems which have Python 3 as the
  “python” command.  This relies on the existence of Python 2.x as the
  “python2” command.
- Added support for clitic traces.  When creating a movement trace with
  the leafBefore and leafAfter functions, if the original phrase has the
  dash tag -CL, the trace inserted will be *CL*.
- Annotald now colors IP-level nodes and the topmost “document” node
  differently.
- Bug fixes.

Release 11.12:
- Various bugs fixed
- Support for ID and METADATA nodes, as sisters of the clause root.
  (Currently, nodes other than ID and METADATA will not work.)
- Change how the coloring is applied to clause roots.  Call
  styleIpNodes() in settings.js after setting the ipnodes variable.
- Add mechanism to hide certain tags from view; see settings.js for
  details.
- Added mousewheel support; use shift+wheel-up/-down to move through the
  tree, sisterwise
– Limit undo history to 15 steps.  This limits how much memory is used
  by Annotald, which could be very high.
- Allow (optional) specification of port on the commandline:
  annotald -p <number> <optional settings file> <.psd file>
  This allows multiple instances of Annotald ot be running at once (each
  on a different port)

Release 11.11:
- Proper Unicode support on OS X and Linux
- Remove dependency on a particular charset in parsed files
- Code cleanup (see hacking.txt for instructions/style guide)
- Add support for lemmata in (POS word-lemma) format
- Speed up the moving of nodes in some cases
- Add a notification message when save completes successfully
- Add an “exit” button, which kills the Annotald server and closes the
  browser window.  Exit will fail if there are unsaved changes
- Change behavior of mouse click selection.  Previously, the following
  behavior was extant:
  1) Click a node
  2) Change the node’s label with a keybaord command
  3) Click another node to select it
  Result: the just-clicked node is made the selection endpoint
  This can be surprising.  Now, in order to make a secondary selection,
  the two mouseclicks must immediately follow each other, without any
  intervening keystrokes.
- Allow context-sensitive label switching commands.  See the included
  settings.js file for an example
- (Experimental) Add a CSS class to each node in the tree corresponding
  to its syntactic label.  This facilitates the specification of
  additional CSS rules (for an example, see the settings file)
- Keybindings can now be specified with control and shift modifier keys
  (though not both together).  The second argument (action to be taken)
  for a binding can now be an arbitrary javascript function; the third
  argument is the argument (singular for now) to be passed to the
  function.
